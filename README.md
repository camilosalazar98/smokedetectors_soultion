Every Minute Counts is currently developing a system in which firefighters can easily detect the root of a fire based on existing building structure. E.M.C. will implement a hybrid alarm-sprinkler system in which nearby firefighters and responsible authorities can pro-actively react to imminent fire dangers.  More importantly, the use of real-time data would allow firefighters to efficiently analyze potential entry and exits points in a locations. This signal will send a unique structure ID via an arduino. The fire department will use the structure ID to find the schematics, floor plans, and type of construction onsite: Masonry or Wood. The current process of firefighters reaching a fire takes 12 minutes, fortunately with our system we wish to essentially shed 3-4 minutes from this by giving firefighters crucial real estate data. This process can all be done during the average response time of 4-6 minutes, so that the responding team will know exactly how to tackle the fire before arriving at the scene.  

A challenge that we expect to face is,  what do we do in the event Wi-Fi is not available? We would then send the signal through a telephone line to alert local authorities. Another implication we foresee is the possible user-friendly approach of our device.  We see this implication with a quite simple approach, add the device to an existing sprinkler system.  Similar to firefighters, we aspire to save lives through time-saving technology.
